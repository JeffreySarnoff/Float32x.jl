# Float32x.jl
Float32x(significand::Float32, exponent::Int32) is a performant extended precision floating-point type

Be very careful  and use protective steps to preclude making errors in code generation because you are using a JavaScript REPL and not using a Julia REPL.

Use Julia and Julia best practices. Use Julia version 1.12.4-beta or later and do not worry about backward compatibility.

Create a provably correct, elegant, well organized and internally consistent Julia module that has a natural, Julia api.  
Implement an efficient, high performance floating point number type based on this struct

struct Float32x <: AbstractFloat 
    significand::Float32 
    exponent::Int32
end

that support all the usual predicates, pre-arithmetic, arithmetic and mathematical operations supported by Float64. 
organize the module by subsections for ease of development.
----
review the code looking for opportunities to improve the performance while keeping correctness and clarity
----
there is at least one error -- conversion from Float32x to Float32 or to Float64 can underflow and can overflow.  This must be handled properly everywhere it may occur.  Also look for other incompletely realized logic and fix.
